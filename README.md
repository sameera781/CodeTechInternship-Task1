Project Overview: Student Grade Management Program
This project involves developing a Java program to manage and track student grades for various subjects or assignments. The application will allow users (teachers, students, or administrators) to input grades, calculate averages, and display performance metrics like letter grades or GPA. Below are the key components and features of the project:

Core Features
Input Grades

Users can input grades for multiple subjects or assignments.
Support for different grading scales (e.g., percentages, points).
Calculate Averages

Compute the average grade for each subject or assignment.
Optionally, calculate weighted averages if grades have different importance (e.g., final exams vs. homework).
Display Results

Show overall grades in a clear and organized format.
Include:
Numerical average.
Letter grade (based on a predefined grading scale).
GPA (using a 4.0 scale or customizable format).
Additional Features (optional but beneficial)

Validation of Inputs: Ensure valid numerical entries for grades.
Subject Overview: Allow users to view grades and averages for specific subjects.
Grade Editing: Enable updating or removing previously entered grades.
Persistent Storage: Save and load data using files (e.g., CSV) for reuse.
User Interface: Provide a text-based or graphical user interface for ease of use.
Technical Components
Data Structures

Use arrays, ArrayLists, or HashMaps to store grades.
Associate subjects/assignments with grades for easy tracking.
Algorithms

Grade input and processing logic.
Calculation of averages, letter grades, and GPA.
Classes and Objects

Create a Student class to encapsulate student details and their grades.
Possible additional classes: Subject, Assignment, or GradeManager.
Error Handling

Handle invalid input (e.g., non-numeric grades).
Provide meaningful error messages.
Customization

Allow customizable grading scales or GPA systems.
Project Workflow
Requirements Gathering: Define what grades and metrics need to be tracked.
Design: Sketch out classes, methods, and program flow.
Implementation: Write the Java code incrementally, starting with core features.
Testing: Validate calculations and user input handling.
Enhancements: Add optional features and refine user interaction.
